[PagePerformance]
; The configuration below provides the possibility to enable capping of values used for generating 'sum/total' and 'average' metrics for page performance reports.
; This allows to reduce the impact of single failed performance measurements.
;
; The recommended caps are at 100-fold an avg/high value. Thereby one wrong value in 10,000 values results in a 1% deviation:
; (1x 100N + 9999x N) / 10000 ~= 101% N
;
; By default capping is disabled. To enable capping overwrite the configs below with a value higher than 0.
