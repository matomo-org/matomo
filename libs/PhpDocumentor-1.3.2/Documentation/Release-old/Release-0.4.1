PhpDocumentor Version 0.4.1	The BETA Release
################################################################################
################################################################################

This release brings PhpDocumentor to a new level.  PhpDocumentor is now capable of
parsing any project documented with the parser from phpdoc.de in mind, as well
as projects that will make phpdoc.de's parser choke.

PhpDocumentor is fully ready for parsing of any project.

We added support for:
* documenting include/require/include_once/require_once
* @param without a variable name (phpdoc.de style), the parser is smart and fills it in
* @var to specify a class variable's type
* inheritance of package/subpackage to classes, so you don't have to add a DocBlock with @package to every child class
* class trees by package
* default package is not documented if nothing is in it, generated docs can be used right out of the box

We changed the parser from a long switch statement to a lookup function table, with a
slight improvement in speed, which is dramatic for large projects, as well as allowing
much more detailed documentation of the parser.

Thanks to Gregory Beaver <cellog@users.sourceforge.net> for all his help on
making this release possible.  He will be gone until late May so development
will slow down for a bit, but don't worry 1.0 will be released before he gets 
back.

The plan to update the template engine has been pushed to 1.0.  This will change
the basic syntax for loops and includes, I will provide documentation so anyone
who has custom templates should be able to make a quick update to the new engine.
Also if you have a custom template and you think others would enjoy email it to
me, or post it on the SF site and i'll include it in the main release.

TODO for 1.0:
* add warnings/errors like phpdoc.de with line number information.
* add template HOWTO
* continue to improve and update documentation as features are added
* improve the web interface
* make a spiffy new default template, perhaps a few others
* specific ordering of tag output
