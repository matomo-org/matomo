PhpDocumentor Version 0.4.2	The BETA Release
################################################################################
################################################################################

This releases fixes a number of annoying bugs that were preventing people from
using 0.4.1.  It also adds a number of new features, there is a new template
that mimics phpdoc.de's output and a the blank page can now be written by the 
user.  To create your own blank page just create a packagename.html file.  You 
can look at http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/phpdoc_l0l33t/ to see an example of
both of these.

The ablility to set the title on the output documentation was also added.

Thanks to Gregory Beaver <cellog@users.sourceforge.net> for all his help on
making this release possible.  He will be gone until late May so development
will slow down for a bit, but don't worry 1.0 will be released before he gets 
back.

TODO for 1.0:
* add warnings/errors like phpdoc.de with line number information.
* add template HOWTO
* continue to improve and update documentation as features are added
* improve the web interface
* make a spiffy new default template, perhaps a few others
* specific ordering of tag output
