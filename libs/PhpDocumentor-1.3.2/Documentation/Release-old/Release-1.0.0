The PHPDocumentor team would like to announce the release of PHPDocumentor
1.0.0 STABLE.  This is a stable release with all features implemented and 
known bugs fixed.  Getting to a stable release has been a long process and
the team would like to thank everyone who has helped along the way.  Without
bug submissions, feature requests, and encouragement, we wouldn't be here.

The past month has been very productive for the project, in the week since
1.0.0rc1 we have closed 40 bugs, and in the month leading to the 1.0.0rc1 release we
closed 68 bugs and added a number of new features.  This hard work had turned
phpDocumentor in a stable project that should be able to document anything
you throw at it.

PHPDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

For users new to PHPDocumentor, PHPDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
  	($string = <<< EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
	documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
	documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
	for tags and the included template engine
  --open source, GPL

Changes from the release candidate include:
  --fixes to bugs with parsing extremely large projects
  --linking to defines fixed
  --new templates for dom supporting browsers that allows for 
  	minimizing/maximizing classes in the left list
  --brand new template spec in the spec/templates directory
  --better error handling, new unknown tags array in parserDocBlock for
    Converter use in custom templates
  
Changes from version 0.4.2a include:
  --resolution of many bugs
  --the addition of intermediary parsing structures that nearly double parsing speed
    and allow for new Converter class to process output
  --improved class inheritance and package handling
  --error and warning system
  --improved inline documentation and external documentation

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes

PHPDocumentor is ready for immediate use documenting any PHP project,
