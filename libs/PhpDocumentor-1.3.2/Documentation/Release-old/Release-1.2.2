The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.2.2.  This is a bugfix maintenance release.  The biggest change is to the
DocBook/peardoc2, CHM and PDF converters.  All three have advanced from beta
to stable and are ready for production use in generating multiple documentation
formats.  The PDF Converter now uses color syntax highlighting for all source
code!

WARNING: in order to install phpDocumentor using pear, you MUST apply the
patch publicweb-PEAR-1.2.1.patch.txt to the core of PEAR 1.2.1 (not phpDocumentor,
PEAR, to be absolutely clear).  After applying the patch, install with
this command:

pear install /path/to/PhpDocumentor-1.2.2/package.xml

you MUST use this command if you plan to use the web interface:

pear config-set publicweb_dir /path/to/public_html/pear

where /path/to/public_html/pear is a subdirectory of a webserver.  With this
patch, if the document root is /path/to/public_html, then you can browse to
the web interface simply by opening http://localhost/pear/PhpDocumentor/

Several critical bugs were discovered in the implementation of HighlightParser,
post-processing of tutorials.  In addition, the algorithm used to find file-level
documentation was changed to be more natural.  All users should upgrade existing
installations to 1.2.2

Note that the license of phpDocumentor 1.2.2 is different from phpDocumentor 1.1.0.
phpDocumentor 1.2.2 is under the PHP License version 3.0, full text is in
PHPLICENSE.txt

for PEAR programmers, the new --pear command-line switch will be a boon.  Leave
it on by default if your package follows PEAR coding and directory naming standards

------
IMPORTANT: phpDocumentor 1.2.2 requires PHP version 4.1.0 or greater.
phpDocumentor will function best with PHP version 4.3.0 or greater, as it will
use of the tokenizer extension if php 4.3.0 is installed for a tremendous
increase in parsing speed.
------

Speaking of speed, do NOT run the PDF Converter with --sourcecode = on for any
medium to large sized projects.  I had to kill a PDF generation after 36 hours
on a Pentium IV 2.66GHz computer - 36 hours!  The design of the PDF generation
library is tremendously inefficient, probably on the order of O(n^2).  I'd fix
this if I knew anything about PDF.  If there are any users out there with the
time and expertise to look into the algorithms used by CPdf, we would all
appreciate it.

phpDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

Once again, phpDocumentor brings a great increase in usability with the 1.2
branch.  The addition of a tokenizer-based parser increases parsing speed by
up to 4 times (that's 400% faster) compared to previous versions.  In addition,
scalability has been improved, allowing generation of documents in multiple
output formats with one command.  The usage of config files makes repetitive
parsing tasks straightforward and reduces the chance for error.

The addition of DocBlock templates, extended documentation (tutorials) parsing,
and many other new features make this release the most useful automatic
documentor for any programming language.

The default HTML Converter has been ported to a new Smarty-based converter,
HTMLframesConverter, and all of the old templates have been ported to the new
Smarty-based format.  The HTMLdefaultConverter has been deprecated since its
functionality is redundant.  Due to the time it takes to convert a template to
the new format, the phpDocumentor team extends an offer to do this conversion
for anyone who has a brand new template.  We may also include the template in a
future release, if permission is granted.

Due to interest from PEAR programmers, there is a new beta-quality XML:DocBook
converter with peardoc2 templates.  This converter could also generate other
DocBook formats, if desired, but does not generate indexing for this release.

The PDF Converter has stepped up to beta-quality, is fully templatable, and
has most bugs completely fixed.  The CHM converter has also taken major strides
and is beta quality.

As predicted, the Smarty template engine is the primary template engine for
all converters.

For users new to phpDocumentor, phpDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
  	($string = <<< EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
	documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
	documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
	for tags and the included template engine
  --open source, GPL
  

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes

phpDocumentor 1.2.2 ready for production use documenting any PHP project,
download it and try the most advanced solution for PHP documentation
today.
