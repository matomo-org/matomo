REQUIREMENTS:

Smarty requires PHP 4.0.6 or later.
See the on-line documentation for complete install instructions.

INSTALLATION (quick):

* copy the files under the libs/ directory to a directory that is in your PHP
  include_path, or set the SMARTY_DIR constant and put them in this directory.
  (if you upgrade from versions before 2.5.0 be aware that up to Smarty 2.4.2
  all necessary files where in the distribution's root directory, but are now
  in libs/.)

* for each application using Smarty, create a "templates", "configs", and a
  "templates_c" directory, be sure to set the appropriate directory settings in
  Smarty for them. If they are located in the same directory as your
  application, they shouldn't need to be modified. Be sure the "templates_c"
  directory is writable by your web server user (usually nobody). chown
  nobody:nobody templates_c; chmod 700 templates_c You can also chmod 777 this
  directory, but be aware of security issues for multi-user systems. If you are
  using Smarty's built-in caching, create a "cache" directory and also chown
  nobody:nobody.

* setup your php and template files. A good working example is in the on-line
  documentation.

* TECHNICAL NOTE: If you do not have access to the php.ini file, you can change
  non-server settings (such as your include_path) with the ini_set() command.
  example: ini_set("include_path",".:/usr/local/lib/php");
