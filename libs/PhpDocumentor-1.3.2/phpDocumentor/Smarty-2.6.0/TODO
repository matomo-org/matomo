* handle asp style tags in $php_handler
* support implementations of prefiltes, mods, and others as class methods.
* ability to concatenate values/strings together
* fix all E_NOTICE warnings
* make simple math easier
* caching all but parts of the template
* change plugins so $smarty variable always comes first
* get cache ttl with function call
FIX: make inserts use normal functions before plugins
UPD: change it so that if template comes from some resource,
     that resource stays as the default, no need to specify it
     in includes.
