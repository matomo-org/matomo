UserAgentParser is a php library to parse user agents and extracts browser name & version, 
and operating system.

UserAgentParser is NOT designed to parse bots user agent strings; UserAgentParser will only
be accurate when parsing user agents coming from Javascript Enabled browsers!

UserAgentParser is designed for simplicity and will accuratly detect most used web browsers,
is regularly updated to detect newly OS and browsers.

Potential limitations:
- it does NOT detect sub sub versions, ie. the "5" in 1.4.5 ; this is design decision to simplify the version number
- it does NOT have the notion of operating system "types", ie "Windows". it only has "Windows XP", "Windows Vista", etc.
- it does NOT properly detect search engine, bots, etc. user agents, it's designed to detect browsers with javascript enabled.
