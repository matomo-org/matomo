0.9.6:

* New, easier to use, replot() method for placing plots in tabs, accordions,
  resizable containers or for changing plot parameters programmatically.
* Updated legend renderer for pie charts to draw swatches which will
  print correctly.
* Fixed issue #118 with patch from taum so autoscale option will
  honor tickInterval and numberTicks options

0.9.5.1:

* Fixed bug where tooltip not working with OHLC and candlestick charts.
* Added additional marker styles: plus, X and dash.


0.9.5:

* Implemented "zoomProxy".  zoomProxy allows zooming one plot from another 
  such as an overview plot.
* Zooming can now be constrained to just x or y axis.
* Enhanced cursor plugin with vertical "dataTracking" line.  This is a line
  at the cursor location with a readout of data points at the line location
  which are displayed in the chart legend.
* Changed cursor tooltip format string.  Now one format string is used for
  entire tooltip.
* Added mechanisms to specify plot size when plot target is hidden or plot
  height/width otherwise cannot be determined from markup.

  These include enablePlugins to globally set the default plugin state on/off
  and defaultHeight/defaultWidth to specify default plot height/width.

* Changed targetId property of the plot object so it now includes a "#" before
  the id string.
* Improved tick and body sizing of Open Hi Low Close and candlestick charts.

  compressed  distribution packages will build fine.
* Lots of examples were added to a separate examples directory to better show
  functionality of jqPlot for local testing with the distribution.
* Many various bug fixes and other minor enhancements.

* Fixed undesirable behavior where point labels for points off the plot
  were being rendered.
* Added edgeTolerance option to point label renderer to control rendering of 
  labels near plot edges.

  so no rotated label support.  This feature is currently experimental.
* Fixed bug #52, needed space in tick div tag between style and class declarations
