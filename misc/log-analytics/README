Piwik Server Log Analytics: Import your server logs in Piwik!
=============================================================


Requirements
------------
 - This is currently in BETA TESTING. The parameters name and behavior might change
   until the final stable release. Please use with care, expect bugs, and report your 
   suggestions and advice. 
 - Python 2.6 or 2.7. Python 3.x is not supported.
 - Update to Piwik 1.7.2-RC1 or newer
   Download Piwik RC from: http://builds.piwik.org/piwik-1.7.2-rc1.zip

How to use this script?
-----------------------
The most simple way to import your logs is to run:

    ./import_logs.py --url=piwik.example.com /path/to/access.log

You must specify your Piwik URL with the --url argument.
The script will automatically read your config.inc.php file to get the authentication
token and communicate with your Piwik install to import the lines.
The default mode will try to mimic the Javascript tracker as much as possible,
and will not track bots, static files, or error requests.

If you wish to track all requests the following command would be used:
    python /path/to/piwik/misc/log-analytics/import_logs.py --url=http://mysite/piwik/ access.log --idsite=1234 --recorders=4 --enable-http-errors --enable-http-redirects --enable-static --enable-bots

(remember this is BETA release)

How to import your logs automatically every day?
------------------------------------------------
You must first make sure your logs are automatically rotated every day. The most
popular ways to implement this are using either:
    - logrotate: http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html
    It will work with any HTTP daemon.
    - rotatelogs: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/rotatelogs.html
    Only works with Apache.
    - let us know what else is useful and we will add it to the list

Your logs should be automatically rotated and stored on your webserver, for instance in daily logs
/var/log/apache/access-%Y-%m-%d.log (where %Y, %m and %d represent the year,
month and day). 
You can then import your logs automatically each day (at 0:01). Setup a cron job with the command:

    0 1 * * * /path/to/piwik/misc/log-analytics/import-logs.py -u piwik.example.com `date --date=yesterday +/var/log/apache/access-\%Y-\%m-\%d.log`

Performance
-----------
With an Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.10GHz (2 cores, 4 virtual cores with Hyper-threading),
running Piwik and its MySQL database, between 250 and 300 records were imported per second.

The import_logs.py script needs CPU to read and parse the log files, but it is actually
Piwik server itself (i.e. PHP/MySQL) which will use more CPU during data import. 

To improve performance, 
(1) by default, the script one thread to parse and import log lines. 
    you can use the --recorders option to specify the number of parallel threads which will 
    import hits into Piwik. We recommend to set --recorders=N to the number N of CPU cores 
    that the server hosting Piwik has. The parsing will still be single-threaded, 
    but several hits will be tracked in Piwik at the same time.
(2) the script will issue hundreds of requests to piwik.php - to improve the Piwik webserver performance
    you can disable server access logging for these requests.
    Each Piwik webserver (Apache, Nginx, IIS) can also be tweaked a bit to handle more req/sec.
