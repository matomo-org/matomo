containing a  list of `state()`\n * and `transition()` entries to be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * @param name An identifying string.\n * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of `state()`\n * and `transition()` declarations.\n *\n * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.\n * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that\n * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:\n *\n * `[@triggerName]=\"expression\"`\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the\n * previous and current values against any linked transitions.\n * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.\n *\n * ### Usage Example\n *\n * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided\n * name value.\n * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and\n * transition declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: \"my-component\",\n *   templateUrl: \"my-component-tpl.html\",\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger\n * by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using an inline function\n * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide\n * if its associated animation should be run.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.\n * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:\n string]: any}): boolean {\n *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here\n *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';\n * }\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [\n *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [\n *         // the animation sequence code\n *       ]),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"yes-please-animate\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations\n * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents\n * all animations from rendering.\n * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable\n * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers\n * within the element.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,\n * along with any inner animations.\n *\n * ### Disable animations application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,\n * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.\n * This means that you can disable all animations for an app\n * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`\n * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate\n * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nexport function trigger(name: string, definitions: AnimationMetadata[]): AnimationTriggerMetadata {\n  return {type: AnimationMetadataType.Trigger, name, definitions, options: {}};\n}\n\n/**\n * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n *\n * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n * The default unit is milliseconds.\n *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n * during its runtime.

The condition is a Boolean expression or function that compares\n * the previous and current animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur.\n * When the state criteria of a defined transition are met, the associated animation is\n * triggered.\n *\n * @param stateChangeExpr A Boolean expression or function that compares the previous and current\n * animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur. Note that  \"true\" and \"false\"\n * match 1 and 0, respectively. An expression is evaluated each time a state change occurs in the\n * animation trigger element.\n * The animation steps run when the expression evaluates to true.\n *\n * - A state-change string takes the form \"state1 => state2\", where each side is a defined animation\n * state, or an asterix (*) to refer to a dynamic start or end state.\n *   - The expression string can contain multiple comma-separated statements;\n * for example \"state1 => state2, state3 => state4\".\n *   - Special values `:enter` and `:leave` initiate a transition on the entry and exit states,\n * equivalent to  \"void => *\"  and \"* => void\".\n *   - Special values `:increment` and `:decrement` initiate a transition when a numeric value has\n * increased or decreased in value.\n * - A function is executed each time a state change occurs in the animation trigger element.\n * The animation steps run when the function returns true.\n *\n * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()` or\n * `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the animation,\n * and additional developer-defined parameters. Provided values for additional parameters are used\n * as defaults, and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the transition data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * The template associated with a component binds an animation trigger to an element.\n *\n * ```HTML\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * All transitions are defined within an animation trigger,\n * along with named states that the transitions change to and from.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *  // define states\n *  state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *  state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *  ...]\n * ```\n *\n * Note that when you call the `sequence()` function within a `{@link animations/group group()}`\n * or a `transition()` call, execution does not continue to the next instruction\n * until each of the inner animation steps have completed.\n *\n * ### Syntax examples\n *\n * The following examples define transitions between the two defined states (and default states),\n * using various options:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // Transition occurs when the state value\n * // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n * transition(\"on => off\", animate(500))\n * // Run the same animation for both directions\n * transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500))\n * // Define multiple state-change pairs separated by commas\n * transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Special values for state-change expressions\n *\n * - Catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into the page and the\n * destination state is unknown:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *  style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *  animate(500)\n *  ])\n * ```\n *\n * - Capture a state change between any states:\n *\n *  `transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\"))`\n *\n * - Entry and exit transitions:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *   ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n *   ])\n * ```\n *\n * - Use `:increment` and `:decrement` to initiate transitions:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\":increment\", group([\n *  query(':enter', [\n *     style({ left: '100%' }),\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *   ]),\n *  query(':leave', [\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *  ])\n * ]))\n *\n * transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *  query(':enter', [\n *     style({ left: '100%' }),\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *   ]),\n *  query(':leave', [\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *  ])\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * ### State-change functions\n *\n * Here is an example of a `fromState` specified as a state-change function that invokes an\n * animation when true:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition((fromState, toState) =>\n *  {\n *   return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *  },\n *  animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Animating to the final state\n *\n * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value\n * with no style data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,\n * for the element to reach the final state. Angular automatically adds or removes\n * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n *\n * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,\n * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n *  ])\n * ```\n * ### Boolean value matching\n * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression\n * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n **/\nexport function transition(\n    stateChangeExpr: string|\n    ((fromState: string, toState: string, element?: any, params?: {[key: string]: any}) => boolean),\n    steps: AnimationMetadata|AnimationMetadata[],\n    options: AnimationOptions|null = null): AnimationTransitionMetadata {\n  return {type: AnimationMetadataType.Transition, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options};\n}\n\n/**\n * Produces a reusable animation that can be invoked in another animation or sequence,\n * by calling the `useAnimation()` function.\n *\n * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()`\n * or `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the\n * animation, and additional developer-defined parameters.\n * Provided values for additional parameters are used as defaults,\n * and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * The following example defines a reusable animation, providing some default parameter\n * values.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n *   animate('{{ time }}',\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n *   ],\n *   { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n * ```\n *\n * The following invokes the defined animation with a call to `useAnimation()`,\n * passing in override parameter values.\n *\n * ```js\n * useAnimation(fadeAnimation, {\n *   params: {\n *     time: '2s',\n *     start: 1,\n *     end: 0\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * If any of the passed-in parameter values are missing from this call,\n * the default values are used.
