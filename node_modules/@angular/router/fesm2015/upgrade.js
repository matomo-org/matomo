/**
 * Normalizes and parses a URL.
 *
 * - Normalizing means that a relative URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of
 *   the application document.
 * - Parsing means that the anchor's `protocol`, `hostname`, `port`, `pathname` and related
 *   properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.
 *
 * While this approach has wide compatibility, it doesn't work as expected on IE. On IE, normalizing
 * happens similar to other browsers, but the parsed components will not be set. (E.g. if you assign
 * `a.href = 'foo'`, then `a.protocol`, `a.host`, etc. will not be correctly updated.)
 * We work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized URL
 * and assigning it again. This correctly populates all properties.
 *
 * See
 * https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/2c7400e7d07b0f6cec1817dab40b9250ce8ebce6/src/ng/urlUtils.js#L26-L33
