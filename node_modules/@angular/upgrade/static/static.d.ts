 * @description
 *
 * A helper function that allows an Angular component to be used from AngularJS.
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](api?query=upgrade%2Fstatic)
 * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AOT compilation*
 *
 * This helper function returns a factory function to be used for registering
 * an AngularJS wrapper directive for "downgrading" an Angular component.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Let's assume that you have an Angular component called `ng2Heroes` that needs
 * to be made available in AngularJS templates.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="ng2-heroes"}
 *
 * We must create an AngularJS [directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)
 * that will make this Angular component available inside AngularJS templates.
 * The `downgradeComponent()` function returns a factory function that we
 * can use to define the AngularJS directive that wraps the "downgraded" component.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="ng2-heroes-wrapper"}
 *
 * For more details and examples on downgrading Angular components to AngularJS components please
 * visit the [Upgrade guide](guide/upgrade#using-angular-components-from-angularjs-code).
 *
 * @param info contains information about the Component that is being downgraded:
 *
 * - `component: Type<any>`: The type of the Component that will be downgraded
 * - `downgradedModule?: string`: The name of the downgraded module (if any) that the component
 *   "belongs to", as returned by a call to `downgradeModule()`. It is the module, whose
 *   corresponding Angular module will be bootstrapped, when the component needs to be instantiated.
 *   <br />
 *   (This option is only necessary when using `downgradeModule()` to downgrade more than one
 *   Angular module.)
 * - `propagateDigest?: boolean`: Whether to perform {@link ChangeDetectorRef#detectChanges
 *   change detection} on the component on every
 *   [$digest](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$digest). If set to `false`,
 *   change detection will still be performed when any of the component's inputs changes.
 *   (Default: true)
 *
 * @returns a factory function that can be used to register the component in an
 * AngularJS module.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * A helper function to allow an Angular service to be accessible from AngularJS.
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](api?query=upgrade%2Fstatic)
 * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AOT compilation*
 *
 * This helper function returns a factory function that provides access to the Angular
 * service identified by the `token` parameter.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Examples
 *
 * First ensure that the service to be downgraded is provided in an `NgModule`
 * that will be part of the upgrade application. For example, let's assume we have
 * defined `HeroesService`
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="ng2-heroes-service"}
 *
 * and that we have included this in our upgrade app `NgModule`
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="ng2-module"}
 *
 * Now we can register the `downgradeInjectable` factory function for the service
 * on an AngularJS module.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="downgrade-ng2-heroes-service"}
 *
 * Inside an AngularJS component's controller we can get hold of the
 * downgraded service via the name we gave when downgrading.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="example-app"}
 *
 * <div class="alert is-important">
 *
 *   When using `downgradeModule()`, downgraded injectables will not be available until the Angular
 *   module that provides them is instantiated. In order to be safe, you need to ensure that the
 *   downgraded injectables are not used anywhere _outside_ the part of the app where it is
 *   guaranteed that their module has been instantiated.
 *
 *   For example, it is _OK_ to use a downgraded service in an upgraded component that is only used
 *   from a downgraded Angular component provided by the same Angular module as the injectable, but
 *   it is _not OK_ to use it in an AngularJS component that may be used independently of Angular or
 *   use it in a downgraded Angular component from a different module.
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * @param token an `InjectionToken` that identifies a service provided from Angular.
 * @param downgradedModule the name of the downgraded module (if any) that the injectable
 * "belongs to", as returned by a call to `downgradeModule()`. It is the module, whose injector will
 * be used for instantiating the injectable.<br />
 * (This option is only necessary when using `downgradeModule()` to downgrade more than one Angular
 * module.)
 *
 * @returns a [factory function](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) that can be
 * used to register the service on an AngularJS module.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * A helper function for creating an AngularJS module that can bootstrap an Angular module
 * "on-demand" (possibly lazily) when a {@link downgradeComponent downgraded component} needs to be
 * instantiated.
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](api?query=upgrade/static) library for hybrid upgrade apps that
 * support AOT compilation.*
 *
 * It allows loading/bootstrapping the Angular part of a hybrid application lazily and not having to
 * pay the cost up-front. For example, you can have an AngularJS application that uses Angular for
 * specific routes and only instantiate the Angular modules if/when the user visits one of these
 * routes.
 *
 * The Angular module will be bootstrapped once (when requested for the first time) and the same
 * reference will be used from that point onwards.
 *
 * `downgradeModule()` requires either an `NgModuleFactory` or a function:
 * - `NgModuleFactory`: If you pass an `NgModuleFactory`, it will be used to instantiate a module
 *   using `platformBrowser`'s {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapModuleFactory bootstrapModuleFactory()}.
 * - `Function`: If you pass a function, it is expected to return a promise resolving to an
 *   `NgModuleRef`. The function is called with an array of extra {@link StaticProvider Providers}
 *   that are expected to be available from the returned `NgModuleRef`'s `Injector`.
 *
 * `downgradeModule()` returns the name of the created AngularJS wrapper module. You can use it to
 * declare a dependency in your main AngularJS module.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/lite/module.ts region="basic-how-to"}
 *
 * For more details on how to use `downgradeModule()` see
 * [Upgrading for Performance](guide/upgrade-performance).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * Apart from `UpgradeModule`, you can use the rest of the `upgrade/static` helpers as usual to
 * build a hybrid application. Note that the Angular pieces (e.g. downgraded services) will not be
 * available until the downgraded module has been bootstrapped, i.e. by instantiating a downgraded
 * component.
 *
 * <div class="alert is-important">
 *
 *   You cannot use `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` in the same hybrid application.<br />
 *   Use one or the other.
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * ### Differences with `UpgradeModule`
 *
 * Besides their different API, there are two important internal differences between
 * `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` that affect the behavior of hybrid applications:
 *
 * 1. Unlike `UpgradeModule`, `downgradeModule()` does not bootstrap the main AngularJS module
 *    inside the {@link NgZone Angular zone}.
 * 2. Unlike `UpgradeModule`, `downgradeModule()` does not automatically run a
 *    [$digest()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$digest) when changes are
 *    detected in the Angular part of the application.
 *
 * What this means is that applications using `UpgradeModule` will run change detection more
 * frequently in order to ensure that both frameworks are properly notified about possible changes.
 * This will inevitably result in more change detection runs than necessary.
 *
 * `downgradeModule()`, on the other side, does not try to tie the two change detection systems as
 * tightly, restricting the explicit change detection runs only to cases where it knows it is
 * necessary (e.g. when the inputs of a downgraded component change). This improves performance,
 * especially in change-detection-heavy applications, but leaves it up to the developer to manually
 * notify each framework as needed.
 *
 * For a more detailed discussion of the differences and their implications, see
 * [Upgrading for Performance](guide/upgrade-performance).
 *
 * <div class="alert is-helpful">
 *
 *   You can manually trigger a change detection run in AngularJS using
 *   [scope.$apply(...)](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$apply) or
 *   [$rootScope.$digest()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$digest).
 *
 *   You can manually trigger a change detection run in Angular using {@link NgZone#run
 *   ngZone.run(...)}.
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * ### Downgrading multiple modules
 *
 * It is possible to downgrade multiple modules and include them in an AngularJS application. In
 * that case, each downgraded module will be bootstrapped when an associated downgraded component or
 * injectable needs to be instantiated.
 *
 * Things to keep in mind, when downgrading multiple modules:
 *
 * - Each downgraded component/injectable needs to be explicitly associated with a downgraded
 *   module. See `downgradeComponent()` and `downgradeInjectable()` for more details.
 *
 * - If you want some injectables to be shared among all downgraded modules, you can provide them as
 *   `StaticProvider`s, when creating the `PlatformRef` (e.g. via `platformBrowser` or
 *   `platformBrowserDynamic`).
 *
 * - When using {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapmodule `bootstrapModule()`} or
 *   {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapmodulefactory `bootstrapModuleFactory()`} to bootstrap the
 *   downgraded modules, each one is considered a "root" module. As a consequence, a new instance
 *   will be created for every injectable provided in `"root"` (via
 *   {@link Injectable#providedIn `providedIn`}).
 *   If this is not your intention, you can have a shared module (that will act as act as the "root"
 *   module) and create all downgraded modules using that module's injector:
 *
 *   {@example upgrade/static/ts/lite-multi-shared/module.ts region="shared-root-module"}

 *
 * In this example you can see that we must derive from the `UpgradeComponent`
 * base class but also provide an {@link Directive `@Directive`} decorator. This is
 * because the AOT compiler requires that this information is statically available at
 * compile time.
 *
 * Note that we must do the following:
 * * specify the directive's selector (`ng1-hero`)
 * * specify all inputs and outputs that the AngularJS component expects
 * * derive from `UpgradeComponent`
 * * call the base class from the constructor, passing

 * An `NgModule`, which you import to provide AngularJS core services,
 * and has an instance method used to bootstrap the hybrid upgrade application.
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](api?query=upgrade/static)
 * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AOT compilation*
 *
 * The `upgrade/static` package contains helpers that allow AngularJS and Angular components
 * to be used together inside a hybrid upgrade application, which supports AOT compilation.
 *
 * Specifically, the classes and functions in the `upgrade/static` module allow the following:
 *
 * 1. Creation of an Angular directive that wraps and exposes an AngularJS component so
 *    that it can be used in an Angular template. See `UpgradeComponent`.
 * 2. Creation of an AngularJS directive that wraps and exposes an Angular component so
 *    that it can be used in an AngularJS template. See `downgradeComponent`.
 * 3. Creation of an Angular root injector provider that wraps and exposes an AngularJS
 *    service so that it can be injected into an Angular context. See
 *    {@link UpgradeModule#upgrading-an-angular-1-service Upgrading an AngularJS service} below.
 * 4. Creation of an AngularJS service that wraps and exposes an Angular injectable
 *    so that it can be injected into an AngularJS context. See `downgradeInjectable`.
 * 3. Bootstrapping of a hybrid Angular application which contains both of the frameworks
 *    coexisting in a single application.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {UpgradeModule} from '@angular/upgrade/static';
 * ```
 *
 * See also the {@link UpgradeModule#examples examples} below.
 *
 * ### Mental Model
 *
 * When reasoning about how a hybrid application works it is useful to have a mental model which
 * describes what is happening and explains what is happening at the lowest level.
 *
 * 1. There are two independent frameworks running in a single application, each framework treats
 *    the other as a black box.
 * 2. Each DOM element on the page is owned exactly by one framework. Whichever framework
 *    instantiated the element is the owner. Each framework only updates/interacts with its own
 *    DOM elements and ignores others.
 * 3. AngularJS directives always execute inside the AngularJS framework codebase regardless of
 *    where they are instantiated.
 * 4. Angular components always execute inside the Angular framework codebase regardless of
 *    where they are instantiated.
 * 5. An AngularJS component can be "upgraded"" to an Angular component. This is achieved by
 *    defining an Angular directive, which bootstraps the AngularJS component at its location
 *    in the DOM. See `UpgradeComponent`.
 * 6. An Angular component can be "downgraded" to an AngularJS component. This is achieved by
 *    defining an AngularJS directive, which bootstraps the Angular component at its location
 *    in the DOM. See `downgradeComponent`.
 * 7. Whenever an "upgraded"/"downgraded" component is instantiated the host element is owned by
 *    the framework doing the instantiation. The other framework then instantiates and owns the
 *    view for that component.
 *    1. This implies that the component bindings will always follow the semantics of the
 *       instantiation framework.
 *    2. The DOM attributes are parsed by the framework that owns the current template. So
 *       attributes in AngularJS templates must use kebab-case, while AngularJS templates must use
 *       camelCase.
 *    3. However the template binding syntax will always use the Angular style, e.g. square
 *       brackets (`[...]`) for property binding.
 * 8. Angular is bootstrapped first; AngularJS is bootstrapped second. AngularJS always owns the
 *    root component of the application.
 * 9. The new application is running in an Angular zone, and therefore it no longer needs calls to
 *    `$apply()`.
 *
 * ### The `UpgradeModule` class
 *
 * This class is an `NgModule`, which you import to provide AngularJS core services,
 * and has an instance method used to bootstrap the hybrid upgrade application.
 *
 * * Core AngularJS services
 *   Importing this `NgModule` will add providers for the core
 *   [AngularJS services](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service) to the root injector.
 *
 * * Bootstrap
 *   The runtime instance of this class contains a {@link UpgradeModule#bootstrap `bootstrap()`}
 *   method, which you use to bootstrap the top level AngularJS module onto an element in the
 *   DOM for the hybrid upgrade app.
 *
 *   It also contains properties to access the {@link UpgradeModule#injector root injector}, the
 *   bootstrap `NgZone` and the
 *   [AngularJS $injector](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$injector).
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Import the `UpgradeModule` into your top level {@link NgModule Angular `NgModule`}.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region='ng2-module'}
 *
 * Then inject `UpgradeModule` into your Angular `NgModule` and use it to bootstrap the top level
 * [AngularJS module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/angular.Module) in the
 * `ngDoBootstrap()` method.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region='bootstrap-ng1'}
 *
 * Finally, kick off the whole process, by bootstraping your top level Angular `NgModule`.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region='bootstrap-ng2'}
 *
 * {@a upgrading-an-angular-1-service}
 * ### Upgrading an AngularJS service
 *
 * There is no specific API for upgrading an AngularJS service. Instead you should just follow the
 * following recipe:
 *
 * Let's say you have an AngularJS service:
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="ng1-text-formatter-service"}
 *
 * Then you should define an Angular provider to be included in your `NgModule` `providers`
 * property.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="upgrade-ng1-service"}
 *
 * Then you can use the "upgraded" AngularJS service by injecting it into an Angular component
 * or service.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/full/module.ts region="use-ng1-upgraded-service"}
