# Contributing to iframe-resizer

Looking to contribute something? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

**Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests.  These should be raised on 
Stack Overflow ([`iframe-resizer`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/iframe-resizer) tag).**


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. **Lint your code** &mdash; Use [jshint](http://jshint.com/)
   to ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test
   case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What
would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix
any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. 


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features or refactoring code),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

In lieu of a formal style-guide, take care to maintain the existing coding 
style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test 
your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
