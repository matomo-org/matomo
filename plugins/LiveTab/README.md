# Piwik LiveTab Plugin

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform [Piwik](http://piwik.org). It allows you to keep an eye on the number of live visitors in the browser tab. It displays the number of visits, actions, unique visitors or converted goals in the last X minutes in the browser tab. The number will be updated every minute.

For better and faster readability the value will be shortened when greater than 1000. For instance to 3.12K or 3.43M.
