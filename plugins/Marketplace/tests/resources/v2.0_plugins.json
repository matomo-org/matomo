The tracked data will be used to make Piwik better. Thank you for your help!\n* your own Piwik (can be configured optionally)\n* a custom Piwik (can be configured optionally)\n\n### What is Piwik doing to make sure the data is anonymized?\n\nWe are very careful in what we track and we make sure to anonymize data that could contain user data.\n\n* We overwrite the page title as the title could contain the name of the viewed website\n* We remove any referrer information\n* We replace URL paramaters with a predefined value apart from a few whitelisted ones to make sure no actual token_auth, CSRF token or user defined value will be tracked\n* On demo-anonymous.piwik.org 3 bytes of the IP are anonymised (eg when IP is 192.168.1.1 we track only 192.0.0.0). The original IP is not used to identify your location and provider information is not collected. \n* We do not just track any outlinks or downloads\n\n### When should I not install this plugin?\n\nIf you have developed a custom Piwik plugin that contains for example the name of your business in any of the following names we recommend to not install this plugin as it might be tracked:\n\n* name of a plugin\n* name of a controller action\n* name of a report\n* name of a widget\n* name of an API method\n\nPlugins that are installed via the Marketplace should not pose a problem as their names don't contain any user specific information such as the name of your business.\n\nWe track any information as efficient as possible to not slow down your Piwik.

A new menu \"Chat\" is available, which allows to browse all conversations.\n\nSoon, a reporting system will be integrated, which will show figures like conversion rate or engagement, in function of the Chat's use.\n\nAfter installing the plugin, you have to modify your tracking code. It includes the file \"javascripts\/client\/client.js\", which waits for the Tracker() to initialize, then appends an iframe to the page. This iframe requests the \"popout\" action of the controller, where the plugin tries to identify the visitor based on his visitorID or configID.\n\n## Changelog\n\nv0.2.2 :\n\n+ Add DB Versioning support\n\nv0.2 :\n\n+ Piwik 2.5.0 ready\n+ Add automatic messages based on segment recognition\n+ General improvement on client popout\n    + Load message over ajax\n    + Add moment.js\n    + Update the communication (based on easyXDM) between the popout and its parent iframe. See : https:\/\/github.com\/VincentLahaye\/piwik-chat\/commit\/ced4662d83cc8efc98b58b27e92ab6d06bb29546\n+ Update VisitorProfile popup\n    + Improve textarea input interractions\n+ Rewrite a lot of code regarding the \"model\" file Conversation.php, now split in different files\n\nv0.1.6 :\n\n+ Add a reporting bug system\n\n\nv0.1.5 :\n\n+    Notification system improved\n    +    Add email notification to offline staf members\n    +    Add title notification\n    +    Improve sound and menu notification, now working on all CoreHome module\n+    Add german translation\n+    Fix wrong inclusion paths on client popout\n+    Fix online staff indicator on client popout\n\n\nv0.1 :\n\n+   Basic chat functions with client\/server communication and Piwik integration\n+   Add additional inputs in the visitor profile in order to save personal informations about a visitor (name, email, phone and comments)\n+   The client shows if someone of the staff is online or not\n+   Sound notifications on both sides\n+   French translation\n\n## Roadmap\nv0.3 :\n\n*   Add a reporting system that shows figures about the module impact\n*   Add external cache support for polling (APC, Memcache, opCache...)\n\n## Academical study\nAs an MSc student in eBusiness, this project is part of my final dissertation : \"How to engage people you don't know at all ?\".\n\nThe first part of this project is to develop the module and its reporting system. Then, the second part will be about analyse the impact of this Chat system (conversion rate, engagement, etc..) in function of its use, and eventually try to determine which way of use is the most efficient. From this research it may be possible to provide advices and answer questions like : What is the best behavior to adopt as an operator? What kinds of automatic messages are the more efficient in order to increase conversion?\n\nTo lead this study, I will need data! And if you support my work, you'll be able to send me your reports via the plugin, in an anonymized way.",

It is an OpenSource software, released under GPL licence, and free of charge. \n\n__Plugin not consider the IIS.__ Sorry. We are waiting patches for IIS.\n\n## Installation\nInstall it via Piwik Marketplace.\n\nThis plugin installer will make directories:\n* yourpiwik\/tmp\/cache\/clickheat\/cache\n* yourpiwik\/tmp\/cache\/clickheat\/logs.\n\nThis plugin uses a different tracker. Please click on the link \"JavaScript\" and put the special Javascript codes into your website.\n\n## FAQ\n__What exactly is included in this feature ?__\n\n* pick up a siteid\n* pick up a period\n* pick up a browser type\n* pick up a specific web page\n\n__And what functions are not included in this feature ?__\n\n* remove special addresses defined on the control panel.\n* remove special browsers defined on the control panel.\n* filters based on added segmentation\n\n__Where is the coordinate information from the browser ?__\n\nClickHeat plugin uses text files to record the coordinate data of each browser in directory: yourpiwik\/tmp\/cache\/clickheat\/logs.\n\n__What is \"click.php returned a status code 403\" ?__\n\nYou have to perform the upgrade immediately to version 0.1.5. I forgot to put .htaccess.\n\n__After installing the plugin, Piwik Administration area shows \"page not found 404 error\".__\n\nThis plugin doesn't consider the IIS. Sorry. And please delete the ClickHeat plugin (yourpiwik\/plugins\/ClickHeat) manually via FTP or Explorer. We are waiting patches for IIS.\n\n__Does it withstands high traffics ?__\n\nThis plugin uses minimal text to record data and file based logging. And when click.php is called from a special Javascript for cgi, just append text on end of the each file. And when you analyze the click data and make a heatmap, plugin will create cached heatmap as png image file. \n\nTherefore, we expect the plugin light works, but we don't know what load it has under Piwik 2.x. So we are very glad, when you inform us about your situation. \n\nPlease see the link [Performance and optimization](http:\/\/www.labsmedia.com\/clickheat\/156894.html) about system resources. If you want performance, you need to avoid to use a cgi, that is possible. It method is explained on the link. \n\n__New click data were added, but not updated heatmap. Why ?__\n\nPlugin places heatmap images in the cache directory: yourpiwik\/tmp\/cache\/clickheat\/cache. Therefore when you suddenly met with such probrem, you can delete cache files, but __do not delete cache directory__.\n\n__Showed a heatmap, but not overlay a heatmap to the target web page. Why ?__\n\nCheck that your website does not set the HTTP header __X-FRAME-OPTIONS__ to __SAMEORIGIN__ as this will prevent this plugin from iframing your website for the heatmap report. Please see [Page Overlay Troubleshooting](http:\/\/piwik.org\/docs\/page-overlay\/#page-overlay-troubleshooting), that is same problem.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* 0.1.0 First beta\n* 0.1.2 to append faq\n* 0.1.3 to append faq\n* 0.1.5 to add .htaccess\n\n## License\nGPL v3 or later\n\n## Support\nPlease direct any feedback to [yamachan@piwikjapan.org](mailto:yamachan@piwikjapan.org).\n",

You can configure a Custom Dimension\nby giving it a name and a scope (Action or Visit). Afterwards you will see a new menu item in the reporting area\nfor each configured dimension and be able to get its data. You can also export the report as a widget, segment by this\n dimenson, and more. For more information read the [Custom Dimensions user guide](https:\/\/piwik.org\/docs\/custom-dimensions\/) or have a look in the FAQ.\n\n*Warning*: Depending on the database size of your Piwik this plugin may take a long time to install.\n\n## FAQ\n\n__I have a large database, can I install the plugin on the command line?__\n\nYes, this is not only possible but even recommended as the installation may take hours. To do this follow these steps:\n\n* Download the Plugin from [https:\/\/plugins.piwik.org\/CustomDimensions](https:\/\/plugins.piwik.org\/CustomDimensions)\n* Extract the files within the downloaded ZIP file\n* Copy the `CustomDimensions` directory into the `plugins` directory of your Piwik\n* Execute the command `.\/console plugin:activate CustomDimensions` within your Piwik directory\n\n__Where can I manage Custom Dimensions?__\n\nCustom Dimensions can be managed by clicking on your username or user icon in the top right. There will be a menu\nitem \"Custom Dimensions\" within the \"Manage\" section of the left menu. By clicking on it you can manage Custom Dimensions.\nPlease note that the permission Admin is required in order to be able to manage them.\n\n__Where can I find the Id for a Custom Dimension?__\n\nYou can find them by going to the \"Manage Custom Dimensions\" page in your personal area. For each dimension you will\nfind the Id in the table that lists all available Custom Dimensions.\n\n__How do I set a value for a dimension in the JavaScript Tracker?__\n\nPlease have a look at the [JavaScript Tracker guide for Custom Dimensions](https:\/\/developer.piwik.org\/guides\/tracking-javascript-guide#custom-dimensions).\n\n__How do I set a value for a dimension in the PHP Tracker?__\n\n`$tracker->setCustomTrackingParameter('dimension' . $customDimensionId, $value);`\n\nPlease note custom tracking parameters are cleared after each tracking request. If you want to keep the same\nCustom Dimensions over all request make sure to call this method before each tracking call.\n\n__I have configured all available Custom Dimension slots, can I add more?__\n\nYes, this is possible. To make a new Custom Dimension slot available execute the following command including the scope option:\n\n```\n.\/console customdimensions:add-custom-dimension --scope=action\n.\/console customdimensions:add-custom-dimension --scope=visit\n```\n\nBe aware that this can take a long time depending on the size of your database as it requires MySQL schema changes.\nYou can directly create multiple Custom Dimension slots. To do this add the option `--count=X`. Usually it doesn't take much\nlonger to create directly multiple new slots.\n\n__Is it possible to delete a Custom Dimension and all of its data?__\n\nIn the UI it is only possible to deactivate a dimension. However, on the command line you can remove a Custom Dimension\nand report it's log data by executing the following console command:\n\n```\n.\/console customdimensions:remove-custom-dimension --scope=$scope --index=$index\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `$scope` and `$index` with the correct values. To get a list of all available indexes execute `.\/console customdimensions:info`.\n\nRemoving a Custom Dimension may take a long time as it requires MySQL schema changes. Currently, only log data is removed. Archived reports will be\nnot deleted currently.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* 0.1.4 Fix a possible JavaScript error if Transitions plugin is disabled\n* 0.1.3 Fix UI of Custom Dimensions was not working properly when not using English as language\n* 0.1.2\n  * New feature: Mark an extraction as case sensitive\n  * New feature : Show actions that had no value defined\n  * New feature : Link to Page URLs in subtables\n* 0.1.1 Bugfixes\n* 0.1.0 Initial release\n\n## Support\n\nPlease direct any feedback to [github.com\/piwik\/plugin-CustomDimensions\/issues](https:\/\/github.com\/piwik\/plugin-CustomDimensions\/issues)\n",

Be very careful\nas to write valid Javascript code since invalid code can break the tracker.\n\n### Other plugins\n\nPlugins can make use of the `CustomTrackerJs.getTrackerJsAdditions` event to register Javascript code to add to\nthe tracker.\n\nFor example this will add a `console.log(\"Hello world!\");` line to the tracker:\n\n```php\nclass MyPlugin extends \\Piwik\\Plugin\n{\n    public function getListHooksRegistered()\n    {\n        return array(\n            'CustomTrackerJs.getTrackerJsAdditions' => 'getTrackerJsAdditions',\n        );\n    }\n\n    public function getTrackerJsAdditions(&$code)\n    {\n        $code .= PHP_EOL .

This method is a bit more complicated to set up, but it leads to immediately updated IP's, as the client will trigger the update whenever a new IP is assigned.\nBut it may not be viable for all users, eg. \n* Not all DDNS clients allow custom update-URL's.\n* The client may be already serving another Server and have no ability to talk to multiple Servers at the same time.\n\nSo, the ___DDNS Hostname___ can be an alternative. Use a DDNS Service that is compatible with your client and enter the hostname from there to have the plugin resolve your dynamic IP. The downside: Updating happens via a sheduled task every hour, so there might be small windows with the new IP still being tracked, but not the old one.\n\n__What data do I need to set for DDNS Update__\n\nYou need to set a custom URL to be triggered for an update.\nYour personal update-URL is shown in your piwik installation (user-menu > Personal > DDNS Settings).\n\nThe URL has the following scheme:\n```\nhttp{s}:\/\/{piwik.url}\/index.php?module=ExcludeByDDNS&action=update&token_auth={token_auth}\n```\n\n- {s} Use HTTPS if available.\n- {piwik.url}: The URL to your piwik installation.\n- {token_auth}: Your API auth token (user-menu > Platform > API).\n\nThere is no need to set user, password or domain name.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- Version 0.4.0 - Compatibility for Piwik > 2.4.0\n- Version 0.3.0 - Various improvements and translations\n- Version 0.2.0 - Beta Release\n- Version 0.1.0 - Alpha Release\n\n## Support\n\nPlease direct any feedback to [stefan@piwik.org](mailto:stefan@piwik.org)\n\n## Contribute\n\nFeel free to create issues and pull requests.\n\n## License\n\nGPLv3 or later\n\n",

What can I do?__\n\nMaybe you have some kind of access restriction for your Piwik like http auth. The Url needs to be public accessible, or at least accessible to those, who should be able to see the counter.\n\n__How can I display the counter for all data in the past__\n\nTo do that, set period to ```range``` and date to something like ```1992-01-01,today```.\n\nThe full URL for the image would then look like:\n```\nhttp:\/\/piwik.url\/index.php?module=FlagCounter&action=image&idSite=1&period=range&date=1992-01-01,today&cols=2&rows=6\n``` \n\n__Can I use a custom font?__\n\nCurrently all ttf fonts located in the ```fonts``` directory within this plugin are available for usage. If you place a new font there, you should be able to use it.\n\n\n## Changelog\n\n- Version 0.1 - Alpha Release\n- Version 0.2 \n  - improved image generation (automatic spacing between items)\n  - possibility to show country codes besides or instead of the flags\n- Version 0.3\n  - added ability to choose a font family, size & color\n\n## Support\n\nPlease direct any feedback to [stefan@piwik.org](mailto:stefan@piwik.org)\n\n## Contribute\n\nFeel free to create issues and pull requests.\n\n## License\n\nGPLv3 or later\n\nNote: The fonts bundled with this plugin are under the following licenses\n- OpenSans: Apache license\n- Roboto: Apache license\n- Raleway: SIL Open Font License\n- Cantarell: SIL Open Font License\n\n",

Not more and not less.\nThe database schema and UI stays untouched, so all Piwik statistics can be used like you would use a internet GeoIP database.\n\n\n__How to configure\/install this plugin \/ the networks?__\n\nAfter installation and activation of the plugin, open the file `piwik\/config\/IntranetGeoIP.data.php`\n\nYou can their add your location information and their subnetworks.\n\nSee the file `piwik\/config\/IntranetGeoIP.data.php` or see the readme on github https:\/\/github.com\/ThaDafinser\/IntranetGeoIp\n\n\n__What statistics are available?__\n\nIf you create a full configuration data file, you'll see\n* Visitor -> Realtime visitor map\n* Visitor -> Location and provider\n* and many more...(in generall all statistics are available like using a internet GeoIP database)\n\n\n__Why there stands provider \"unknown\" in my visitor log?__\n\nIf your installation is stock, all visitors will get this \"flag\" to show you, what IPs are not matched.\nYou can adjust or remove this, by changing the \"noMatch\" block in your `IntranetGeoIP.data.php` file.\nIf you remove the complete block, none matched visitors will be skipped by this plugin.\nBut you can also fill all possible visitorInfos like you are used for matched IP addresses.\n\n\n__Can i use this plugin with a internet GeoIP database side by side?__\n\nYes you can.\nJust remove or comment out the `noMatch` block in your configuration file.\n\n__Note about the configuration?__\n\nInside the array key `visitorInfo` you can freely add\/remove all available columns from the `log_visit` table you want.\nThe keys below are just a suggestion, since they are the only one which make sense currently IMO.\nAll available fields, see here: http:\/\/developer.piwik.org\/guides\/persistence-and-the-mysql-backend#visits\n\nInside they key `networks` add all subnetworks which apply to this location.\n\n```php\nreturn [\n    \/*\n     * If the IP was not matched, apply these data to visitorInfo\n     * You can also apply here all possible visitorInformation data if you want\n     *\/\n    'noMatch' => [\n        'visitorInfo' => [\n            'location_provider' => 'unknown'\n        ]\n    ],\n    \n    [\n        'visitorInfo' => [\n            \/\/ISO-3166 alpha-2 code http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ISO_3166-1\n            'location_country' => 'at',\n            \n            \/\/the region code (i take them from piwik\/libs\/MaxMindGeoIp\/geoipregionvars.php\n            'location_region' => '08',\n            \n            \/\/should be freetext\n            'location_city' => 'Muntlix',\n            \n            \/\/get this from a picker, e.g. http:\/\/www.tytai.com\/gmap\/\n            'location_latitude' => '47.282024',\n            'location_longitude' => '9.662304',\n            \n            \/\/enter your company name or do it based on your domain hierarchy\n            'location_provider' => 'myCompany'\n        ],\n        'networks' => [\n            \/\/enter here all subnetworks for this location\n            \/\/use a subnetwork calculator, e.g. http:\/\/jodies.de\/ipcalc\n            '10.59.0.0\/19',\n            '170.56.251.200\/29'\n        ]\n    ],\n    \n    \/\/add more blocks live above\n];\n```\n",

If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard and a new link in the top navigation.\n\nThe widget will show the performance index of a site that auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a 30 minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors in any 30 minute period of the last 30 days.\n\nThis plugin is inspired by the [piwik barometer plugin](https:\/\/github.com\/halfdan\/piwik-barometer-plugin) and uses a lightly modified jQuery-Dynameter (original by [Tzechiu Lei](http:\/\/tze1.com\/dynameter\/).\n\n**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 5 million visits per day.**\n\n(Tested with piwik 2.7.0, but supposed to run with older versions)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall it via Piwik Marketplace OR install manually:\n\n1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.\n\n   ```\n   cd plugins\/\n   git clone https:\/\/github.com\/chanzler\/piwik-performance-monitor.git PerformanceMonitor\n   ```\n\n2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins\n\n3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.\n\n4. When you update: As there have been made several changes in v0.2.0 you might have to clear your cache (console core:clear-caches) \n\n## FAQ\n\n###Features\nHere is a list of features that are included in this project:\n\n* Live widget (\"Performance Monitor\") with key performance indices\n* Add an item to the top navigation (\"Performance overview\") which displays the performance monitor widget for all your sites (configurable).\n\n###Configuration\n*Refresh interval*: Defines how often the widgets will be updated. Every 30 seconds is a good value to choose.\n\n*Measurement period*: Defines the measurement period in minutes. 5 minutes is a good value to choose.\n\n*Comparison period*: Defines the period (x * 24h) the last 30 minutes are compared to. A good value for small sites with more or less static content is 30. For sites with peak days on weekends for example 1 will be a good value. 1 is also a good value for very big sites with a lot of traffic. You will have to play around with this value a little bit and figure out whalt will fit your needs.\n\n*Sites in overview*: Defines which sites are displayed in the overview.  \n\n## Changelog\n\n### 0.2.5 Bugfix Release\n* fixed bug with timezones that match \/^UTC[+-]*\/\n\n### 0.2.4 Bugfix Release\n* reengineering of scheduled task\n\n### 0.2.3 Bugfix Release\n* fixed bug in scheduled task\n\n### 0.2.2 Bugfix Release\n* fixed an installation bug\n\n### 0.2.0 Second Beta\n* made the plugin configurable by settings\n* added more key performance indices\n* performance overview now links to the dashboards\n* fixed the timezone bug (configure timezone for each site properly)\n* fixed several minor bugs\n\n### 0.1.0 First Beta\n* initial release\n\n## License\n\nGPL v3 or later\n\n## Support\n\n* Please direct any feedback to [frank@intersolve.de](mailto:frank@intersolve.de)\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this plugin, feel free to send pull requests!\n\n",

Those peaks can be handled much better by using this queue.\nWriting a tracking request into the queue is very fast (a tracking request takes in total a few milliseconds) compared to a regular tracking request (that takes multiple hundreds of milliseconds). The queue makes sure to process the tracking requests whenever possible even if it takes a while to process all requests after there was a peak.\n\n*This plugin is currently BETA and there might be issues causing not tracked requests, wrongly tracked requests or duplicated tracked requests.*\n\nHave a look at the FAQ for more information.\n\n## FAQ\n\n__What are the requirements for this plugin?__\n\n* [Redis server 2.8+](http:\/\/redis.io\/) - [Redis quickstart](http:\/\/redis.io\/topics\/quickstart)\n* [phpredis PHP extension](https:\/\/github.com\/nicolasff\/phpredis) - [Install](https:\/\/github.com\/nicolasff\/phpredis#installingconfiguring)\n* Transactions are used and must be supported by the SQL database.\n\n__Where can I configure and enable the queue?__\n\nIn your Piwik instance go to \"Settings => Plugin Settings\". There is a config section for this plugin.\n\n__When will a queued tracking request be processed?__\n\nFirst you should know that multiple tracking requests will be inserted into the database at once using\n[bulk tracking](http:\/\/developer.piwik.org\/api-reference\/tracking-api#bulk-tracking) as soon as a configurable number\nof requests is queued. By default we will check whether enough requests are queued during a regular tracking request\nand start processing them right after sending a response to the browser to make sure a user won't have to wait until\nthe queue has finished to process all requests. Have a look at this graph to see how it works:\n\n![How it works](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/piwik\/plugin-QueuedTracking\/master\/docs\/How_it_works.png)\n\n__I do not want to process queued requests within a tracking request, what shall I do?__\n\nDon't worry, if this solution doesn't work out for you for some reason you can disable it and process all queued\nrequests using the [Piwik console](http:\/\/developer.piwik.org\/guides\/piwik-on-the-command-line). Just follow these steps:\n\n* Disable the setting \"Process during tracking request\" in the Piwik UI under \"Settings => Plugin Settings\"\n* Setup a cronjob that executes the command `.\/console queuedtracking:process` for instance every minute\n* That's it\n\nThe `queuedtracking:process` command will make sure to process all queued tracking requests whenever possible and the\ncommand will exit as soon as there are not enough requests queued anymore. That's why you should setup a cronjob to start\nthe command every minute as it will just start processing again as soon as there are enough requests. Be aware that it won't\nspeed up processing queued requests when starting this command multiple times. Only one process will actually replay\nqueued requests at a time.\n\nExample crontab entry that starts the processor every minute:\n\n`* * * * * cd \/piwik && .\/console queuedtracking:process >\/dev\/null 2>&1`\n\n__Can I keep track of the state of the queue?__\n\nYes, you can. Just execute the command `.\/console queuedtracking:monitor`. This will show the current state of the queue.\n\n__Can I improve the speed of inserting requests from the Redis queue to the database?__\n\nYes, you can by adding more workers. By default only one worker is activated at a time and only one worker processes tracking requests from Redis to the database. When inserting tracking requests into the database, at time of writing this, about 80% of the time is spent in PHP and the database might be rather bored. If you have multiple CPUs available on your server you can add more workers. You can do this by going in the Piwik Admin interface to \"Plugin Settings\". There will be a setting \"Number of queue workers\". Increase this number to the number of CPUs you want to dedeciate for processing requests. Best practice is to add more workers step by step. So first increase this number to 2 and check if the tracking request insertions is fast enough for you. If not and you have more CPUs available, increase the number again.\n\nWhen using multiple workers it might be worth to lower the number of \"Number of requests to process\" to eg 15 in \"Plugin Settings\". By default 25 requests are inserted in one step by using transactions. This means different workers might have to wait for each other. By lowering that number each worker will block the DB for less time.\n\nIf you process requests from the command line via `.\/console queuedtracking:process` make sure to always start enough workers. Each time you execute this command one worker will be started. If already enough workers are in process no new worker will be started and the command just finishes immediately.\n\n__How fast are the requests inserted from Redis to the Database?__\n\nThis very much depends on your setup and hardware. With fast CPUs you can achive up to 250req\/s with 1 worker, 400req\/s with 2 workers and 1500req\/s with 8 workers (tested on a AWS c3.x2large instance).\n\n__How should the redis server be configured?__\n\nMake sure to have enough memory to save all tracking requests in the queue. One tracking request in the queue takes about 2KB,\n20.000 tracking requests take about 50MB. All tracking requests of all websites are stored in the same queue.\nThere should be only one Redis server to make sure the data will be replayed in the same order as they were recorded.\nIf you want to configure Redis HA (High Availability) it is possible to use Redis Sentinel see further down.\nWe currently write into the Redis default database by default but you can configure to use a different one.\n\n__Why do some tests fail on my local Piwik instance?__\n\nMake sure the requirements mentioned above are met and Redis needs to run on 127.0.0.1:6379 with no password for the\nintegration tests to work. It will use the database \"15\" and the tests may flush all data it contains. Make sure\nit does not contain any important data.\n\n__What if I want to disable the queue?__\n\nYou might want to disable the queue at some point but there are still some pending requests in the queue. We recommend to\nchange the \"Number of requests to process\" in plugin settings to \"1\" and process all requests using the command\n`.\/console queuedtracking:process` shortly before disabling the queue and directly afterwards. It is still possible to\nprocess remaining request once the queue is disabled but new tracking requests won't be written into the queue.\n\n__How can I access Redis data?__\n\nYou can either acccess data on the command line via `redis-cli` or use a Redis monitor like [phpRedisAdmin](https:\/\/github.com\/ErikDubbelboer\/phpRedisAdmin).\nIn case you are using something like a Redis monitor make sure it is not accessible by everyone.\n\n__The processor won't start processing again as it things another processor is processing the data already, what can I do?__\n\nFirst make sure there is actually no processor processing any requests. For example by executing the command\n`.\/console queuedtracking:monitor`. In case you are using the command line to process tracking requests make sure there\nis no processer running using the Linux command `ps`. If you are sure there is no process running you can release the lock\nby executing the command `.\/console queuedtracking:lock-status`. This will output more information which locks are in use and how to unlock them. Afterwards everything should work as normal again.\nYou should actually never have to do this as a lock automatically expires after a while. It just may take a while depending\non the amount of requests you are importing.\n\n__How can I test my Redis \/ QueuedTracking setup in case I'm getting errors?__\n\nThere is a command to test some the connection to Redis as well as some needed features: `.\/console queuedtracking:test`.\n\nIt might directly give you an error message if something goes wrong that helps you to resolve the issue. If your queue\nis always locked you might be as well interested in executing `.console queuedtracking:lock-status`.\n\n__How can I debug in case something goes wrong?__\n\n* Use the command `.\/console queuedtracking:monitor` to view the current state of all workers\n* Use the command `.\/console queuedtracking:lock-status` to view the current state of all locks\n* Set the option `-vvv` when processing via `.\/console queuedtracking:process -vvv` to enable the tracker debug mode for this run. This will print detailed information to screen.\n* Enable tracker mode in `config.ini.php` via `[Tracker] debug=1` if processing requests during tracking is enabled.\n* Use the command `.\/console queuedtracking:print-queued-requests` to view the next requests to process in each queue. If you execute this command twice within 1-10 minutes, and it outputs the same, the queue is not being processed most likely indicating a problem.\n\n__I am using the Log Importer in combination with Queued Tracking, is there something to consider?__\n\nYes, we recommend to set the \"Number of requests to process\" to `1` as the log importer usually sends multiple requests at once using bulk tracking already.\n\n__How can I configure the QueuedTracking plugin to use Redis Sentinel?__\n\nYou can enable the Sentinel in the plugin settings. Make sure to specify the correct Sentinel \"master\" name.\n\nWhen using Sentinel, the `phpredis` extension is not needed as it uses a PHP class to connect to your Redis. Please note that calls to Redis might be a little bit slower.\n\n__Can I configure multiple Sentinel servers?__\n\nYes, once Sentinel is enabled you can configure multiple servers by specifying multiple hosts and ports comma separated via the UI.\n\n__Are there any known issues?__\n\n* In case you are using bulk tracking the bulk tracking response varies compared to the regular one. We will always return\n either an image or a 204 HTTP response code in case the parameter `send_image=0` is sent.\n* Anything related with Cookies won't work\n* By design this plugin can delay the insertion of tracking requests causing real time plugins to not show the actual data since\n under load tracking requests may take a while until they are replayed.\n\n## Changelog\n\n0.3.1\n\n- Fixed Redis Sentinel was not working properly. Sentinel can be now configured via the UI and not via config. Also\n  multiple servers can be configured now.\n\n0.3.0\n\n- Added support to use Redis Sentinel for automatic failover\n\n0.2.6\n\n- When a request takes more than 2 seconds and debug tracker mode is enabled, log information about the request.\n\n0.2.5\n\n- Use a better random number generator if available on the system to more evenly process queues.\n\n0.2.4\n\n- The command `queuedtracking:monitor` will now work even when the queue is disabled\n\n0.2.3\n\n- Added more tests and information to the `queuedtracking:test` command\n- It is now possible to configure up to 16 workers\n\n0.2.2\n\n- Improved output for the new `test` command\n- New FAQ entries\n\n0.2.1\n\n- Added a new command to test the connection to Redis.

If you change the user Model to contain some extra informations, you should also change this plug-in's handling on the way users are created.\n- This plug-in supports the following user informations retrieval:\n  - username (login)\n  - email\n  - alias (name or fullname)\n  - token (random string length 32chars)\n  - websites (access_level and websites id)\n\n# Configuration\nFor the configuration following settings should be set in config\/config.ini.php\n\n## Datasource:\n\n```\n[datasource]  \ndatasource[\"alias\"] = \"shib\"  \ndatasource[\"login\"] = \"shib\"\ndatasource[\"email\"] = \"shib\"\ndatasource[\"websites\"] = \"shib, ldap\"\ndatasource[\"superuser\"] = \"shib\"\n```\n\nThe datasource helps you to change the way this plug-in accesses the information needed to generate or add users to Piwik. Normally Shibboleth (shib) should suffice. The software will look at the options in config.ini.php as it is ordered. If you want Shibboleth to prevail, add it first. If your first choice for an option is LDAP add (ldap) first. The MySQL database will automatically comes to help if none of the options give a valid result, which is most of the time unlikely. if your User Model is different, you can set other options here. If you use other resources than this tree, you can also define it here and the use the AuthLib class as parent class and extend it to your own Model.\n\n## Shib:\n\n```\n[shib]\nshib[\"login\"] = \"uid\"\nshib[\"alias\"] = \"fullName\"\nshib[\"email\"] = \"mail\"\nshib[\"superuser\"] = \"groupMembership\"\nshib[\"superuser_type\"] = \"string\"\nshib[\"superuser_param\"] = \"cn=RZ-Piwik-Admin\"\nshib[\"to_get_view\"] = \"groupMembership\"\nshib[\"to_get_view_type\"] = \"string\"\nshib[\"to_get_view_param\"] = \"cn=RZ-Piwik-View\"\nshib[\"to_get_admin\"] = \"groupMembership\"\nshib[\"to_get_admin_type\"] = \"string\"\nshib[\"to_get_admin_param\"] = \"cn=RZ-Piwik-View\"\n```\n\nIn shib you can set the Shibboleth parameter in which user data is caught. if you have some other settings it is possible to set them here. The information would be available in Shibboleth class.\n\n## LDAP:\n\n```\n[ldap]\nldap[\"host\"] = \"ldaphost\"\nldap[\"port\"] = 636\nldap[\"user\"] = \"binduser\"\nldap[\"password\"] = \"bindpassword\"\nldap[\"dn\"] = \"binddn\"\nldap[\"to_filter_view\"] = \"(userfilter)\"\nldap[\"to_get_view\"] = \"website attr\"\nldap[\"to_get_type_view\"] = \"string\"\nldap[\"to_filter_admin\"] = \"\"\nldap[\"to_get_admin\"] = \"\"\nldap[\"to_get_type_admin\"] = \"\"\n```\n\nThe same applies here just like the Shibboleth settings above.\n\n## Apache Settings\nTo exclude the public part of piwik, mainly the tracker and piwik.php from the Shibboleth Auth, the following settings have been set in apache VirtualHost.\n\n###Apache 2.2\n```\n<LocationMatch \"^\/(?!piwik.js|piwik.php|opt_out.php)\">\n        AuthType shibboleth\n        ShibRequireSession On\n        require shibboleth\n        require valid-user\n        satisfy any\n<\/LocationMatch>\n```\n\n###Apache 2.4\n```\n<LocationMatch \"^\/(?!piwik.js|piwik.php|opt_out.php)\">\n        AuthType Shibboleth\n        ShibrequestSetting requireSession 1\n        Require valid-user\n        satisfy all\n<\/LocationMatch>\n```\n\n# License\n> The MIT License (MIT)\n\n> Copyright (c) 2015 Pouyan Azari  \n> Copyright (c) 2015 University of W\u00fcrzburg\n\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Additionally the free or the used memory will be displayed.\n\nThe display will be refreshed automatically as often as you like. This can be setup by yourself in the plugin settings.\n\n\n## Screenshots\n**Table Widget**  \n![](https:\/\/github.com\/job963\/SimpleSysMon\/raw\/master\/screenshots\/widgetLiveSysLoad-EN.png)\n\n**Graph Widget**  \n![](https:\/\/github.com\/job963\/SimpleSysMon\/raw\/master\/screenshots\/widgetLiveSysLoadBars-EN.png)\n\n**Plugin Settings**  \n![](https:\/\/github.com\/job963\/SimpleSysMon\/raw\/master\/screenshots\/settingLiveSysLoad-EN.png)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall it via [Piwik Marketplace](http:\/\/plugins.piwik.org\/).\n\nOR \n\nInstall manually:\n\n1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.\n\n   ```\n   cd plugins\/\n   git clone https:\/\/github.com\/job963\/SimpleSysMon.git SimpleSysMon\n   ```\n\n2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins\n\n3. Goto Settings -> Plugin Settings an setup the values for the widget.\n\n4. You will now find the widget under the Simple System Monitor -> Live System Load.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **0.1.0 Initial release**\n  * Display of CPU load\n  * Display of free or used memory    \n\n* **0.1.1 Initial release**\n  * Corrections and error trapping for shared websites where the some values aren't accessible \n  \n* **0.2.0 Graphical display**\n  * Display as bar chart for system load and memory use added \n  \n* **0.2.1 Hungarian language**\n  * Hungarian language added \n  \n* **0.3.0 Bar charts for network and disk**\n  * Two new bars for displaying network traffic (upload and download) and disk usage added\n  * Additional to the percentage values, the real values are display on hover \n\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How is the CPU load calculated?**  \nFor the CPU load the PHP function sys_getloadavg() is used and divided by the number of cores.\n  \n**Why is there a difference between free and used memory?**  \nThere are three \"memory parts\" under Linux:   \n\n* Used memory\n* Cache\n* Free memory\n  \nThe sum of these three parts will be equal to the total memory. But only `used memory` and `free memory` are available as options (in settings).\n  \n**What is the value for 100% network traffic**  \nYou can setup the value for the maximum network traffic in the plugin system settings. The value there must be specified in kB\/s (kilobyte per second). This value is used as 100% network traffic.\n  \n**Does the plugin work on a shared webspace?**  \nIn the most cases a shared webspace doesn't have access to system information. Therefore in these cases, the plugin cannot be used. The pseudo file system \/proc must be accessible.\n  \n**Does the plugin work on Windows system?**  \nIf the server where Piwik is running is using Windows as OS, the plugin doesn't work yet.  \nIf just your browser is running under Windows (and the server runs under Linux) this plugin works well.\n\n## License\n\nGPL v3 or later\n\n## Support\n\nPlease report any issues directly in [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/job963\/SimpleSysMon\/issues). \n\n## Contribute \n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this plugin, feel free to send pull requests!\n\n",

It allows you to score your visitors depending on goals reached, pages visited, email campaigns opened and other factors. In other words this plugin enables you to score your visitors based on actions they do on your website. It has a robust scoring methodology for heating and cooling visitor score.\n\nSnoopy also provides some basic API functions to integrate it with third party applications souch as your CRM or lead management system. More information about the API can be found on [github wiki](https:\/\/github.com\/spletnik\/snoopy-behavioral-scoring\/wiki\/API).\n\n## Installation\n### Automatic\nInstall it via Piwik Marketplace and [configure](#configuration) plugin.\n### Manual installation\n1. Download whole repository as ZIP.\n2. Go to your piwik Administration => Marketplace and click on \"upload a plugin in .zip format.\"\n3. After plugin is upladed press \"Activate plugin\"\n\nIf you did everything correct and you have sufficient permissions on folder plugins, Snoopy should be successfully installed.\n\nNow all you need to do is to set your configuration and create a cron that calculates visitors scores.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Required\nBefore Snoopy starts scoring visitors you first have to tweak some configuration to match your needs.\n\n1. Matching site:\nYou have to select for which site your Snoopy scores visitors. For now only one website property tracking is available.\n\n2. Matching goal:\nSnoopy will start scoring only when specific goal is achieved. You can choose one or more goals as entry point to start .ing.\n\n3. Cooling factor:\nCooling factor is number that tells you how fast visitors will loose their score.\n\nHere is example simulation for factor 1.1\n\n|Number of inactive days|Current penalty|Penalty since beginning|Visitor scores\t|\n|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t100\t\t  \t|\n|\t1\t\t\t\t\t|\t1\t\t\t|\t1\t\t\t\t\t|\t99\t\t  \t|\n|\t2\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.1\t\t\t|\t2.1\t\t\t\t\t|\t97.9\t\t|\n|\t3\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.21\t\t|\t3.31\t\t\t\t|\t96.69\t\t|\n|\t4\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.331\t\t|\t4.641\t\t\t\t|\t95.359\t\t|\n|\t5\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.4641\t\t|\t6.1051\t\t\t\t|\t93.8949\t\t|\n|\t6\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.61051\t\t|\t7.71561\t\t\t\t|\t92.28439\t|\n|\t7\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.771561\t|\t9.487171\t\t\t|\t90.512829\t|\n|\t8\t\t\t\t\t|\t1.9487171\t|\t11.4358881\t\t\t|\t88.5641119\t|\n|\t9\t\t\t\t\t|\t2.14358881\t|\t13.57947691\t\t\t|\t86.42052309\t|\n|\t10\t\t\t\t\t|\t2.357947691\t|\t15.9374246\t\t\t|\t84.0625754\t|\n\nFrom the table you can see that on first inactive day you loose 1 point, \non the  second inactive day you loose 1*factor point\non third inactive day you loose second_day*factor point etc.\n\nThose configuration parameters are mandatory for Snoopy to score propperly. \n\nWhen you are finished with configuration you just need to put this comand as your cronjob and Snoopy will start to calculate your score (This will recalcualte score hourly):\n\n**0 * * * * \/piwik_root\/console snoopybehavioralscoring:recalculate-score**\n\nAdditionally you can pipe log to file:\n\n**0 * * * * \/piwik_root\/console snoopybehavioralscoring:recalculate-score >> \/var\/log\/snoopy.log**\n\n### Optional\n- Enable console full debug\n\nWhen running recalculate-score some additional info is printed, that could be usefull when debuging why score is not calculated properly.\n\n- Campaign entry bonus\n\nBonus score that is added when visitor visits your webpage trough campaign (Google Analytics campaign parameters are set)\n- Special URL's\n\nURL;SCORE pairs that make some of your URL's worth more score points. \n\nFor example:\n\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/contact;3\n\nHere contact page is worth 3 points instead just one.\n## FAQ\n\n__When does my visitors gets scored.__\n\nWhen they reach specified goal in plugin settings.\n\n## Changelog\n0.1.2 - Bugfix for settings + Fixed fatal error on first calculation + Fixed permissions problems\n0.1.1 - Readme changes + minor fixes\n0.1.0 - Initial version\n\n## Support\n\nPlease direct any feedback to info@spletnik.si\n",

For example, if you're looking at visits, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like the other graph visualizations, you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that it shows much more rows.\n\nThe treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the evolution of each row. You can hover over a treemap square to see how much the row changed from the last period. Each treemap square is also colored based on the evolution. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.\n\n## Limitations\n\nCurrently there is one known limitation:\n\n* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.\n",
